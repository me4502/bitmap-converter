# bitmap-converter
Converts black and white images to an array of bits, and vice versa.

To use, just set the filename in bitmap-converter.py at the bottom. This is written with Python 2.7, however should work on Python 3.

This requires the Python PIL framework, most commonly accessed through the fork 'Pillow'.

For installation instructions on Pillow, see [here.](http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)
